# Reflector

Reflector is a unique tower defense game where the player uses lasers and
reflections to defend their base. Unlike traditional tower defense games, the
towers do not automatically aim. Instead, the player decides which direction the
towers will shoot in when placing them. Using that with a combination of
reflectors around the map, the player must defend their base against hordes of
enemies.
